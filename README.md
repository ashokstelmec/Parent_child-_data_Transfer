## This Project shows how to transfer data from Parent to Child and Child to Parent

## From Parent to Child : 
We can pass data from parent to child through #PROPS#, Whether data is variable or function, or objects or arrays or string or anything.

## From Child to parent :
We can pass data from child to its parent only through the argument of a function whose definition is defined in the parent component itself.
